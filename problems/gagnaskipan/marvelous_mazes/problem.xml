<problem name="Marvelous Mazes">
    <description>
		<p>Your mission, if you decide to accept it, is to create a maze drawing program. A maze will consist of the alphabetic characters A-Z, * (asterisk), and spaces.</p>
		<h2>Input and Output</h2>
		<p>Your program will get the information for the mazes from the input file. This file will contain lines of characters which your program must interpret to draw a maze. Each row of the maze will be described by a series of numbers and characters, where the numbers before a character tell how many times that character will be used. If there are multiple digits in a number before a character, then the number of times to repeat the character is the sum of the digits before that character.</p>
		<p>The lowercase letter &ldquo;<tt>b</tt>&rdquo; will be used in the input file to represent spaces in the maze. The descriptions for different rows in the maze will be separated by an exclamation point (<tt>!</tt>) or by an end of line.</p>
		<p>Descriptions for different mazes will be separated by a blank line in both input and output. The input file will be terminated by an end of file.</p>
		<p>There is no limit to the number of rows in a maze or the number of mazes in a file, though no row will contain more than 132 characters.</p>
		<p>Happy mazing!</p>
