<problem name="Malt Guzzler">
    <description>
<p>
Joe is an absolutely obsessive malt drinker,
he simply cannot get enough. Most annoyingly
though, he almost never has any money, so his
only obvious legal way to obtain more malt is
to take the money he gets when he recycles
empty malt bottles to buy new ones. In addition
to the empty bottles resulting from his own
consumption he sometimes finds empty bottles in
the street. One day he was extra thirsty, so he
actually drank malts until he couldn't afford a
new one.
</p>

<h3>Input specification</h3>

<p>
Three non-negative integers e; f; c, where e &lt; 1000 equals the number of empty malt
bottles in Joe's possession at the start of the day, f &lt; 1000 the number of empty malt
bottles found during the day, and 1 &lt; c &lt; 2000 the number of empty bottles required to
buy a new malt.
</p>

<h3>Output specifications</h3>

<p>
How many malts did Joe drink on his extra thirsty day?
