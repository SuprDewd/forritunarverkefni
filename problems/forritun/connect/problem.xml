<problem name="Connect">
    <description>
		<p>When constructing electric circuits one has to connect pairs of points using wire, preferable as short as possible.
In this problem we have an empty circuit board of size <tt>N &times; M</tt> where we want to connect the two points <tt>A<sub>1</sub></tt> and <tt>A<sub>2</sub></tt>
with each other using one wire, and the two points <tt>B<sub>1</sub></tt> and <tt>B<sub>2</sub></tt> with each other using another wire.
The wires must go along the horizontal and vertical edges of the grid (see figure), and the two wires may not share a common vertex.
Determine the minimum length of wire needed to do so. The wire may not go outside the circuit board.</p>

<h2>Input specifications</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, <tt>N</tt> (<tt>2 &le; N &le; 100</tt>) and <tt>M</tt> (<tt>2 &le; M &le; 100</tt>), the grid size of the circuit board.<br />
Then follows four lines containing the coordinates for the points <tt>A<sub>1</sub></tt>, <tt>A<sub>2</sub></tt>, <tt>B<sub>1</sub></tt> and <tt>B<sub>2</sub></tt>, respectively. Each coordinate pair will be described using two integers and will correspond to an intersection point in the grid. The first coordinate will be between <tt>0</tt> and <tt>N</tt> inclusive and the second coordinate between <tt>0</tt> and <tt>M</tt> inclusive. All coordinate pairs will be unique.</p>

<h2>Output specifications</h2>
<p>A single line containing the minimum length of wire needed to connect the points, or &ldquo;<tt>IMPOSSIBLE</tt>&rdquo; if it's not possible to do so.</p>
