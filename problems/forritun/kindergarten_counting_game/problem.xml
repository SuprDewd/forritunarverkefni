<p>
Everybody sit down in a circle. Ok. Listen to me carefully.
<p>
``Woooooo, you scwewy wabbit!''
</p>
Now, could someone tell me how many words I just said?
</p>

<h2>Input and Output</h2>
<p>
Input to your program will consist of a series of lines, each line containing multiple words (at least one).
A ``word'' is defined as a consecutive sequence of letters (upper and/or lower case).
</p>

<p>
Your program should output a word count for each line of input. Each word count should be printed on
a separate line.
