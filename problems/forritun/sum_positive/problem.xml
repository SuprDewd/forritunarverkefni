<problem name="Sum of positive integers">
    <description>
        <p>Write a program that reads ten integer numbers and outputs the sum of all the positive numbers among them. The program should ignore all numbers which are less than or equal to 0. The program should also display count of positive numbers and count of negative numbers or zero.</p>
