<problem name="Max-Min-Average">
    <description>
<p>You are to find the maxima, minima and average values of integer lists.</p>


<h3>Input specification</h3> 

<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer 0 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100 indicating how 
	many test cases your program will test. Each test case consists of two lines, 
	the first containing a single integer, 1 &le; <i>k</i> &le; 100, the length of the list. 
	The second line contains the <i>k</i> integers of the list.</p>

<h3>Output specifications</h3>

	<p>For each test case, output the maximum of the list, prefixed by &quot;<tt>Max: </tt>&quot;, the 
		minimum of the list, prefixed by &quot;<tt>Min: </tt>&quot;, and the average of the list rounded to 
		two decimal places, prefixed by &quot;<tt>Average: </tt>&quot;. The output for two
