<problem name="Integer Inquiry">
    <description>
		<p>One of the first users of BIT&rsquo;s new supercomputer was Chip Diller. He extended his exploration of powers of 3 to go from 0 to 333 and he explored taking various sums of those numbers.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This supercomputer is great,&rdquo; remarked Chip. &ldquo;I only wish Timothy were here to see these results.&rdquo; (Chip moved to a new apartment, once one became available on the third floor of the Lemon Sky apartments on Third Street.)</p>
		<h2>Input specifications</h2>
		<p>The input will consist of at most 100 lines of text, each of which contains a single VeryLongInteger. Each VeryLongInteger will be 100 or fewer characters in length, and will only contain digits (no VeryLongInteger will be negative).</p>
		<p>The final input line will contain a single zero on a line by itself.</p>
		<h2>Output specifications</h2>
		<p>Your program should output the sum of the VeryLongIntegers given in the input.</p>
