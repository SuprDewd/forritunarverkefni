<problem name="Count Words and Characters">
    <description>
        <p>Write a program that will read in a line of text and output the number of occurrences of each letter. Define a word to be any string of letters that is delimited at each end by either whitespace, a period, a comma, or the beginning or end of the line. You can assume that the input consists entirely of letters, whitespace, commas, and periods. When outputting the number of letters that occur in a line, be sure to count upper- and lowercase versions of a letter as the same letter. Output the letters in alphabetical order and list only those letters that do occur in the input line.</p>
